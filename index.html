              Lost and Found has been favorably received. Kirkus Reviews wrote "Readers who (inexplicably) find David Lawrence’s Pickle and Penguin (2004) just too weird may settle in more comfortably with this—slightly—less offbeat friendship tale."[4] and Publishers Weekly called it "beguiling" and described it as a "...gently humorous and heartwarming tale of friendship found, lost and regained".
